# Readme
Why won't use shell to make life easier?
Honestly, i made this script because i think write
echo 'something' | base64 or with the -d flag, is taking too much time, so i decide
to make a little shell script which just copy-paste the syntax, and that's it - Easy, no? 
Well ,for me, it end up found this script very useful.
You can use it on your machine, just copy it to one of your'e PATH directories, so the system use it
to search for commands that can be executed without specifying their full path.
Hope you'll find it useful, and if not, mybe others!
